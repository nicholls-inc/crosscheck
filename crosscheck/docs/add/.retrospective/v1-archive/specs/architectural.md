# Architectural Spec — ADD in Crosscheck

**Status:** Attested v1.1 (Phase 2 re-attestation 2026-05-09 by nicholls-inc; re-drafting cascade from seam validation B-1, B-2, B-3, B-4)
**Phase:** 1 (Specification — Architectural tier)
**Consumes:** IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, IC5, IC6, IC7, IC8, IC9, IC10, IC11, ADR-001, ADR-002, ADR-003, ADR-004, ADR-005, plus inherited disciplines from `skills/intent-check/SKILL.md` and `skills/spec-adversary/SKILL.md` (per S2.3, S2.4 declarations)
**Produces:** the behavioral spec (`docs/add/specs/behavioral.md`, agent-authored) and the per-module functional specs (`docs/add/specs/modules/*.md`, agent-authored)
**Prior attestation:** v1.0 — 2026-05-09 by nicholls-inc (Phase 2 closure; comparison report § 9.4)
**Re-drafted sections in v1.1:** S2.3 (inherits `/intent-check` pipeline), S2.5 (`implementation:` enum extended with `lean-pipeline`), S3.6 / S3.7 / S3.8 (added skill adaptations), S7.1 (dual-track-principle reference). Other sections unchanged from v1.0.

## Purpose

This spec names *what changes* in the Crosscheck plugin to support ADD. It is structurally architectural: it identifies the artifacts to add, the artifacts to modify, the data shapes that flow between them, and the linkage rules. It does *not* specify the prompts inside new skills or the exact Dafny patterns those skills emit — those are functional-spec-tier concerns for the agent to draft.

Sections are numbered hierarchically (`S1`, `S1.1`, `S2`, ...). Each section declares its consumed and produced artifacts.

---

## S1 — Operating-mode tagging

**Consumes:** IC5, IC9, IC11, ADR-001
**Produces:** behavioral spec section "B-modes"; constraints on every existing skill that touches governance; integrity rules covering B-tier linkage quality (S1.2)

### S1.1 — Mode tag location and format

Every module's invariant doc (`docs/invariants/<module>.md`) carries a frontmatter block at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
mode: add | bootstrap
phase: 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5
attested-at: <commit SHA where mode was attested, or "draft">
---
```

The `phase:` field records the module's current ADD phase per `methodology.md` § Phase structure. Bootstrap-mode modules use `phase: 5` (continuous assurance) as the default since they enter Crosscheck post-construction; ADD-mode modules increment monotonically as the module advances. The integrity rules in S1.2 read this field.

For ADD-mode modules whose invariants live in `docs/add/specs/modules/<module>.md` (the dual location accommodates the source-of-truth difference between the two modes), the same frontmatter format applies in that file.

Modules without a frontmatter mode tag default to `bootstrap` for backwards compatibility (per IC9).

### S1.2 — Linkage-graph integrity rules per mode

The deterministic instrumentation (S4.1) checks linkage-graph integrity. Per ADR-001, the rules differ by mode:

- **Bootstrap-mode modules:** require `docs/invariants/<module>.md` exists, has at least one `I` invariant, and each `I` has a covering test. No requirement to trace back to an `IC`.
- **ADD-mode modules:** require `docs/add/specs/modules/<module>.md` exists, has at least one `F` functional spec section, each `F` traces via `consumes:` to an `S` architectural section, and each `S` traces to one or more `IC` claims. Tests are required once Phase 4 begins (the integrity check is mode-aware about which phase the module is in, recorded in the same frontmatter).
- **B-tier linkage quality (per IC11):** every `B` invariant in a module's behavioral spec traces via `consumes:` to at least one `IC` (possibly via an `S` intermediate) and via `produces:` to at least one `F` within its module. Violations are reported as:
  - `orphan-B` — `B` with no `IC` ancestor. Hard violation; integrity check fails.
  - `dangling-B` — `B` with no `F` descendant. Soft violation in Phase 1 (legitimate during derivation); hard violation from Phase 3 onwards.

Cross-module references use the qualified form `M3-billing/I3` per `glossary.md`.

---

## S2 — Greenfield skill set (new skills)

**Consumes:** IC1, IC2, IC3, IC4, ADR-004
**Produces:** four new SKILL.md files at `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`

### S2.1 — `/intent-elicit`

**Trigger phrases:** "elicit intent", "capture vision", "phase zero", "draft intent doc", "start ADD project".

**Argument hint:** `[optional: path to a vision document or rough notes]`

**Owner:** Hellebuyck (specification chain)

**Inputs:** A natural-language vision from the user, either inline in the conversation, in an attached document, or in a draft text file in the repo. The skill is interactive and tolerant of starting from minimal input.

**Outputs:** `docs/add/intent.md` (or whatever path the user prefers; default is `docs/add/intent.md`) containing:
- Vision paragraph
- Numbered `IC` claims, each in ADR-style format (Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences) with explicit observable signals
- Out-of-scope list (numbered `N1`, `N2`, ...)
- Threat model (numbered `TM1`, `TM2`, ...)
- A Status field (Drafted on first emit; transitions to Attested only via human confirmation)

**Behavior contract:**
- Multi-turn conversational. The skill does not produce the full intent doc in one shot; it elicits, drafts, asks for amendment, iterates.
- Refuses to mark Status=Attested without explicit human confirmation in the same exchange.
- Each `IC` includes the observable-signal language so downstream Phase 2 can validate.
- Every commit it produces carries the `Spec-Diff-Classification` trailer (see S6.1) — typically `intent-refinement` for amendments, `propagated-discovery` for additions.

**Interactions:**
- Recommended next skill on completion: `/spec-derive`.
- May call `/intent-check-prose` (S2.3) on completion as a self-check before requesting attestation.

### S2.2 — `/spec-derive`

**Trigger phrases:** "derive spec", "draft architectural spec", "phase one architectural", "build spec from intent".

**Argument hint:** `[optional: path to attested intent doc, defaults to docs/add/intent.md]`

**Owner:** Hellebuyck

**Inputs:** An Attested intent doc.

**Outputs:** `docs/add/specs/architectural.md` containing:
- Numbered `S` sections, each with `consumes:` and `produces:` declarations
- Each section in ADR-style format (Context / Decision / Alternatives / Consequences)
- A "Coverage table" mapping every `IC` to the `S` sections that consume it; every `IC` must appear

**Behavior contract:**
- Refuses to complete (returns Drafted with a notice) if any `IC` from the intent doc is not consumed by at least one `S` section.
- Surfaces alternatives considered for each major architectural choice; the agent must produce at least one alternative per `S` section or explain why no alternative was viable.
- Conversational; does not produce the full spec in one shot.
- Emits the `Spec-Diff-Classification` trailer in commits (typically `propagated-discovery` for new sections, `intent-refinement` after intent amendment).
- Recommended next skill: `/intent-check-prose` for Phase 2 validation.

### S2.3 — `/intent-check-prose` (or `/intent-check --mode=prose`)

**Decision required for the agent:** implement as a new skill or as a mode of the existing `/intent-check`. Recommendation: a new skill, because the inputs differ enough that a mode flag would tangle the existing prompt template. The agent may overrule this if the implementation is genuinely cleaner as a mode; document the choice in a follow-up ADR.

**Inheritance from `/intent-check` (Phase 2 re-draft, propagated discovery from seam validation).** This skill is the existing `/intent-check` pipeline parameterised on a different input shape. The full pipeline structure — Steps 0–8 of `skills/intent-check/SKILL.md` — is inherited verbatim, with the substitutions named below. *Do not re-derive the pipeline*; reuse it. The substantive engineering work of `/intent-check-prose` is the input substitution and the prompt-template adaptation, not the pipeline structure.

**Inheritance substitutions:**

| Aspect | `/intent-check` (existing) | `/intent-check-prose` (this skill) |
|---|---|---|
| **Input triple** | `(invariant prose, covering test, code diff)` | `(intent doc, spec stack)` — no test, no code diff |
| **Back-translator input** | `{code, test}` (blind to invariant prose) | `{spec stack}` (blind to intent doc) |
| **Diff-checker input** | `{invariant_prose, back_translation}` | `{intent_doc, back_translation}` |
| **FP-tracker CSV** | `.assurance/intent-check-fp-tracker.csv` columns `date,invariant_touched,phase_verdict,human_verdict` | `.assurance/intent-check-prose-fp-tracker.csv` columns `date,intent_doc_or_section,phase_verdict,human_verdict` |
| **Attestation file** | `.assurance/intent-check-attestation.json` | `.assurance/intent-check-prose-attestation.json` |
| **Protected files** | files named in the invariant doc | files comprising the spec stack (intent.md, architectural.md, behavioral.md, per-module specs) |

**Inherited verbatim (no substitution needed):**

- **Env vars and thresholds.** `CROSSCHECK_FP_TRIPPED_THRESHOLD` (default `0.30`), `CROSSCHECK_FP_AT_RISK_THRESHOLD` (default `0.20`), `CROSSCHECK_FP_WINDOW_DAYS` (default `14`), with `n ≥ 3` minimum sample. The same env vars are read by `/intent-check`, `/intent-check-prose`, and `/assurance-status` so the user sees identical rates everywhere.
- **Two-section back-translator output.** Section 1 (behavioural guarantees / system description) and Section 2 (rationale comments / "Not covered" markers in the spec stack). Both mandatory; missing/empty (other than `None.`) → re-invoke once; fail on second malformed.
- **Mandatory carve-out scan.** Diff-checker's first step is to scan for scope markers (`Not covered`, `caller-responsibility`, `precondition`, `aspirational`, `known violation`, `privileged`, `exempt`, `out of scope`, `does not apply`) and classify each found clause by the scope-modifier taxonomy. The intent doc's negative-space (`N1`–`N8`) is the natural carve-out source for the prose variant.
- **Fail-closed semantic validation.** Contradictory output (`match=true` with non-trivial `mismatch_reason`) → flip to fail with `confidence_pct=40`, `confidence_basis=spec-ambiguous`, `mismatch_category=missing_property`. Truncated reason (`match=false` and `len(strip(mismatch_reason)) < 20`) → reject as malformed; ask user to re-run.
- **Diff-checker output schema.** Verbatim:
  ```json
  { "match": ..., "mismatch_reason": ..., "mismatch_category": "...", "confidence_pct": 0-100, "confidence_basis": "..." }
  ```
- **Content-hashed attestation.** SHA-256 over sorted, concatenated raw bytes of protected files. Schema:
  ```json
  {
    "protected_files": ["...sorted..."],
    "content_hash": "<64-hex>",
    "verdict": "pass" | "fail",
    "checked_at": "<RFC3339>",
    "pipeline_output": { "back_translation": "...", "diff_result": {...} }
  }
  ```
- **FP definition.** A False Positive is a flagged divergence the human reviewer attests is spurious (e.g., wording difference but semantic equivalence). `human_verdict` legal values are inherited verbatim: `genuine | genuine-planted | partial | spurious`. Empty cells are awaiting review and are excluded from rolling-rate computation.
- **Verdict computation.** `phase_verdict = pass` iff `match == true` AND `confidence_pct >= 80`; else `fail`. Low-confidence matches do not count as clean passes — the attestation says `fail` and the user can override via `/protected-surface-amend`.

**Outputs (substituted):** Same shape as `/intent-check`'s outputs, with paths and protected-file set adjusted per the substitution table above. The Markdown rendering for humans includes per-IC coverage analysis (which `S` consumes each `IC`, and whether the consuming section plausibly satisfies the claim).

**Trigger phrases:** "intent check prose", "phase two validation", "validate spec against intent".

**Argument hint:** `[optional: path to intent doc] [optional: path to architectural spec]`

**Owner:** Hellebuyck.

### S2.4 — `/spec-adversary-prose` (or `/spec-adversary --mode=prose`)

**Decision required for the agent:** as for S2.3 — new skill or mode of existing `/spec-adversary`. Recommendation: extend the existing skill with a mode flag, because adversarial probing is structurally similar across modes (the difference is the input artifact and the lack of a covering test).

**Trigger phrases:** "adversary prose", "probe spec", "phase two adversary", "find spec gaps".

**Argument hint:** `[optional: path to spec section to probe]`

**Owner:** Hellebuyck

**Inputs:** A Drafted spec section (`S` or `B` or `F`).

**Outputs:** A report enumerating:
- Behaviors the spec leaves unconstrained
- Edge cases the spec is silent on
- Questions the spec does not answer
- Candidate invariants or sections that, if added, would close the gap

**Behavior contract:**
- Same kill-criterion discipline as `/spec-adversary` (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence labels; signal-to-noise self-check).
- Does *not* propose changes to the spec; produces probing output the human or Hellebuyck can use to amend.
- Operates on Drafted specs; refuses to probe Ratified ones (those go through full consolidation, not adversarial probing).

### S2.5 — Seam to `/spec-iterate`

**Consumes:** IC3, ADR-004
**Produces:** integrity rule covering the spec ↦ implementation handoff

ADR-004 says the existing `/spec-iterate` flow is reachable from the spec stack — but the seam between a per-module functional spec section and a `/spec-iterate` invocation must be declared, not implicit, so the linkage-graph integrity check (S1.2) can verify it.

**Declaration form.** A functional spec section that is intended to be implemented via `/spec-iterate` records the intent in its frontmatter:

```yaml
---
id: F1.2
status: Drafted
consumes: [S2.1, IC3]
produces: [I1, T1.2]
implementation: spec-iterate
---
```

The `implementation:` field takes one of:

- `spec-iterate` — Layer 1 via the Dafny verify-and-extract chain (`/spec-iterate` → `/generate-verified` → `/extract-code`). Reach band ~22-27% per `docs/research/logic-distribution-analysis.md`.
- `lean-pipeline` (added Phase 2 re-draft, B-2) — Layer 1 via the Lean executable-model + DRT-oracle chain (`/informal-spec` → `/lean-spec` → `/lean-impl` → `/correspondence-review` → `/drt-oracle`). Used when production code is hand- or AI-written and DRT validates against a Lean model. Per `agents/byfuglien.md`, Dafny and Lean are complementary engines at Layer 1, not alternatives.
- `manual` — agent or human writes code directly; no Layer 1 verification chain applies.
- `external` — the implementation lives outside this repo (third-party library, sister repo, etc.).

Other values require a follow-up ADR.

**Integrity rule.** For any `F` section with `implementation:` set to a Layer-1 value, the integrity check (S1.2) requires evidence the chain produced an artifact:

- `implementation: spec-iterate` requires a `.dfy` artifact under the module's verification directory matching the `F` section's slug, *or* an `implementation-status: deferred-to-phase-<n>` note (n in 3..5).
- `implementation: lean-pipeline` requires (a) a `.lean` artifact under the module's `lean/` directory matching the slug, (b) a correspondence-review verdict in `.assurance/correspondence/<module>/<slug>.json` with `verdict: exact | abstraction | approximation` (`mismatch` is a hard violation), AND (c) a DRT-oracle run record under `.assurance/drt-oracle/<module>/`. Equivalently, an `implementation-status: deferred-to-phase-<n>` note skips the check during phase 1-2 derivation.

For `implementation: manual` or `external`, no seam check applies; the standard integrity rule (test must cover invariant) still binds.

**What this section deliberately does not specify.**
- The internals of `/spec-iterate` or the Lean pipeline (out of scope; existing skills).
- The exact Dafny / Lean patterns the agent emits when invoking either chain from an `F` section (functional-spec-tier concern).
- The behaviour when an `F` section's `implementation:` value is `manual` or `external` — those cases follow the standard integrity rule.

## S3 — ADD-mode adaptations to existing skills

**Consumes:** IC1, IC9, ADR-001
**Produces:** modifications (additive only, never removing existing behavior) to a small number of existing SKILL.md files

For each existing skill listed below, the agent must produce a *delta spec* — a description of the smallest change required to make the skill mode-aware without breaking IC9.

### S3.1 — `/assurance-layer-audit`

**Change:** Detect empty-repo state (no manifests, no source files). On empty repo, produce a report explaining that this is an ADD-mode candidate and recommend `/intent-elicit` as the entry point. Existing behavior (manifest-driven layer projection) is unchanged for non-empty repos.

### S3.2 — `/assurance-init`

**Change:** Two additive responsibilities.

1. *Detect ADD-mode state* (`docs/add/` already exists with an Attested intent doc). On ADD-mode state, the "name 1-3 load-bearing modules" question is replaced with "name 1-3 architectural modules from `docs/add/specs/architectural.md`". Modules thus seeded inherit `mode: add` and `phase: <current-phase>` in their frontmatter.
2. *Detect surrounding governance frameworks* — the pre-commit framework in use (pre-commit.com, lefthook, husky, or none) and the CI system in use (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, CircleCI, or none). Detection is conservative: presence of `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `lefthook.yml`, or `.husky/` for pre-commit; presence of `.github/workflows/`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, or `.circleci/config.yml` for CI. The detection result is recorded at `.assurance/governance-detection.json` and is consumed by S6.1 when installing the diff-classification gates.

Existing behavior (load-bearing-module elicitation, governance scaffolding) is unchanged for repos without `docs/add/` and is unchanged for the framework-detection step (the step is purely additive — its output sits alongside existing scaffolding rather than replacing any).

### S3.3 — `/intent-check`

**Change:** No behavioral change to existing `/intent-check`. The new `/intent-check-prose` (S2.3) is a sibling, not a replacement. The existing skill's documentation should reference the prose variant for users in Phase 2.

### S3.4 — `/spec-adversary`

**Change:** If implemented as a mode (per S2.4 architectural recommendation), add the `--mode=prose` flag and route to the prose variant when the input is a Drafted spec. Otherwise, no change; the new skill is sibling.

### S3.5 — `/acceptance-oracle-draft`

**Change:** Detect empty-source-tree state. On empty source tree but with an Attested intent doc, derive surfaces from the *intent doc's observable-signal language* rather than from file-tree scanning. Existing surface-detection behavior unchanged when source files exist.

### S3.6 — `/assurance-status` (added Phase 2 re-draft, B-1)

**Change:** Phase 2 of the status dashboard becomes mode-aware. The existing skill reads `docs/invariants/<module>.md` and surfaces ROADMAP drift, FP rate, kill-criterion triggers. Extension:

1. Read mode tags via `M1-mode-governance/F1.3` (`mode-of`).
2. For each module, classify as bootstrap-mode or ADD-mode.
3. Bootstrap-mode rows (existing behavior): ROADMAP item statuses, coverage gaps, FP rate from `/intent-check`.
4. ADD-mode rows (new): IC trace status (which `IC` is consumed by which `S`), Drafted/Attested/Ratified counts per artifact tier, cascade-pending count from M3's deterministic instrumentation, FP rate from `/intent-check-prose` (computed from the *same env vars* as `/intent-check`).
5. The dashboard aggregates both kinds of rows in a single view; users see all modules with appropriate signals per mode.

The existing `/assurance-status` Phase-1 onboarding gate is unchanged for bootstrap-mode repos. For ADD-mode repos the gate checks for `docs/add/intent.md` with `Status: Attested` instead of `docs/assurance/ROADMAP.md`. Repos in transitional mode (mix) require both gates pass for their respective module sets.

### S3.7 — `/assurance-roadmap-check` (added Phase 2 re-draft, B-1)

**Change:** The drift detector currently scans `docs/assurance/**/*.md` Status fields against actual repo/PR state. Extension: additionally scan `docs/add/**/*.md` for Status-field drift on ADD-mode artifacts.

Drift signals for ADD-mode artifacts:
- An artifact marked `Status: Attested` whose linkage graph shows it consumed an upstream artifact modified after its `last-attested` field (cascade-pending; should be re-drafted).
- An artifact marked `Status: Ratified` that has been edited in place since the prior consolidation pass (Ratified-but-amended is a violation).
- An artifact marked `Status: Superseded-by-N` where the superseding artifact does not exist (broken supersession reference).

The skill emits a unified report covering both ROADMAP-style drift (existing) and ADD-style drift (new), distinguished by source path.

### S3.8 — `/protected-surface-amend` (added Phase 2 re-draft, B-1)

**Change:** The amendment-block generator currently emits governance notes for the two-class partition (Class A: harness/workflow definitions; Class B: module invariants & tests, per `.claude/rules/protected-surfaces.md`).

Extension: ADR-005 adds protected paths for `docs/add/`, `docs/add/audit/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, and `.claude/rules/`. The skill detects which partition a touched file belongs to:

- **Class A (existing)** — harness/workflow + agents/ + .claude/rules/ + `docs/add/` (intent, ADRs, methodology, glossary, architectural spec, acceptance, behavioral, per-module specs). Amendment requires governance note + linkage to a ROADMAP item *or* an ADR.
- **Class B (existing)** — module invariants + property tests. Amendment requires governance note + linkage to a ROADMAP item.
- **Class C (new)** — `docs/add/audit/`. Amendment requires Auditor authorship (via `.assurance/audit-authors.allowlist`) OR a human reviewer; governance note explains the override if a human is amending.

The skill emits the appropriate governance-note shape per detected class. The existing `.claude/rules/protected-surfaces.md` template is extended (additively) to include the ADR-005 paths and the new Class C.

---

## S4 — Deterministic instrumentation

**Consumes:** IC8, ADR-002
**Produces:** behavioral spec sections "B-instrumentation"; auditor agent input contract

### S4.1 — Instrumentation tool

A new tool, `scripts/add-instrumentation/` or `skills/add-instrumentation/SKILL.md` (the agent decides; if it has substantive prompt content, it is a skill; if it is purely deterministic, it is a script). The tool:

1. Reads git history over a configurable window (default 30 days; env var `CROSSCHECK_INSTRUMENTATION_WINDOW_DAYS`).
2. Computes the five signals enumerated in ADR-002:
   - Edit frequency per artifact
   - Change-coupling between artifact pairs
   - Linkage-graph integrity (orphans, dangling refs, cycles)
   - Cascade-pending detection
   - Diff-shape analysis
3. Emits structured output (JSON-lines preferred for ease of consumption) at `.assurance/add-instrumentation-<timestamp>.jsonl`.

The schema is documented in a `references/add-instrumentation-schema.md` file the agent authors as part of S4.1. Schema columns/keys, once committed, are stable.

The tool runs on demand (manually or via the auditor's workflow) and on schedule (CI cron). It does not invoke an LLM. It must be language-agnostic where possible — the Tornhill `xray-skill` precedent is recommended reading.

### S4.2 — Auditor input contract

The Auditor agent's prompt template (S5.1) takes the deterministic-instrumentation output as a structured input. The contract:

- The auditor's prompt receives the output verbatim, not summarised.
- Every verdict the auditor renders cites at least one signal ID from the instrumentation output.
- A verdict with no signal grounding is a malformed output and the agent must re-attempt.

---

## S5 — Auditor agent

**Consumes:** IC6, ADR-003
**Produces:** the auditor agent definition file and the consolidation-pass workflow doc

### S5.1 — Auditor agent definition

A new file `agents/<auditor-name>.md` (slug to be chosen by the agent and human, following the existing hockey-figure naming convention). The file structure mirrors `agents/byfuglien.md` and `agents/hellebuyck.md`:

- Scope statement: read-only access; consumes deterministic signals; produces verdicts.
- Skills owned (none in v1). The Auditor *invokes* `/add-instrumentation` and renders verdicts directly. If `/add-instrumentation` is implemented as a skill (per S4.1's script-vs-skill choice), the skill is plugin-level and *owned by Hellebuyck* (specification chain); the Auditor invokes but does not own it. This preserves the audit/author separation: the Auditor cannot modify the instrumentation it depends on.
- Tool restrictions: explicitly no write tools that allow modification of `docs/add/` (except the Auditor's own report directory `docs/add/audit/`, per ADR-005 § Boundary), `docs/invariants/`, `agents/`, `skills/`, `.claude/rules/`. The restriction is **declared in the Auditor's `agents/<auditor-name>.md` frontmatter** as a `tool-allowlist:` block enumerating the permitted tools (read tools, the `/add-instrumentation` invocation, and write tools constrained to `docs/add/audit/<date>.md` and its JSON sidecar). The plugin loader honours the frontmatter at agent-spawn time; agent runs with restricted tools cannot bypass via prompt injection because the constraint is harness-level, not prompt-level.
- Prompt template: a structured prompt that takes the deterministic output, walks the auditor through per-artifact verdict rendering, and emits the report.

### S5.2 — Consolidation-pass workflow

A new file `docs/examples/workflows/consolidation-pass.md` describing:

- When the pass runs (manual on-demand; scheduled weekly in early projects, monthly later).
- What inputs it requires (the instrumentation output, the linkage graph, the diff-classification log).
- What outputs it produces (a Markdown report at `docs/add/audit/<date>.md` plus a JSON sidecar for tooling).
- The verdict vocabulary (Settled / Active / Drifted) with examples of each.
- The remediation-proposal format for Drifted artifacts.
- The human adjudication workflow that follows.

The user's existing `assurance-squad.md` workflow at `ev-energy/ev.shapes` is a partial precedent the agent can reference; the v1 consolidation-pass workflow extends it with the settled/active/drifted distinction.

---

## S6 — Diff classification enforcement

**Consumes:** IC7, ADR-005
**Produces:** the pre-commit hook stub, the CI job stub, the diff-classification log schema

### S6.1 — Enforcement gates and log

Three artifacts:

1. **Pre-commit hook**, integrated with the existing pre-commit framework detected by `/assurance-init` (pre-commit.com, lefthook, or husky). The hook checks the structured commit-message trailer per ADR-005. It is fast (< 5s per Crosscheck's existing dual-track principle) and does not invoke an LLM.

2. **CI job**, added to the CI system detected by `/assurance-init` (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI). The job re-verifies the trailer and appends to `.assurance/diff-classification-log.csv`.

3. **Log schema**, documented in `references/diff-classification-log-schema.md`. Format: **JSON-lines** at `.assurance/diff-classification-log.jsonl`. Each line is a JSON object with keys: `timestamp`, `commit_sha`, `author`, `classification`, `justification`, `modified_files` (array), `related_ids` (array, parsed from commit body — IC, S, B, F, I, T, ADR identifiers).

4. **Squash and rebase handling.** Squash-merging into a protected branch is permitted only when the squashed commit carries a summary `Spec-Diff-Classification` trailer covering the merged range. The CI gate runs on the *final* commit set on the merge target, not the pre-squash commits. Force-pushes that rewrite history on protected branches are rejected at the CI gate; the dual-track principle applies (a fast pre-receive hook on the remote, mirrored by the CI job).

Implementation should follow the precedent of `/invariant-coverage-scaffold` (which generates similar dual-track artifacts).

---

## S7 — Documentation surface updates

**Consumes:** IC10
**Produces:** edits to `README.md`, `docs/skills.md`, `docs/agents.md`, and possibly new files under `docs/`

### S7.1 — README updates

Add a new section "Operating modes" to the plugin README describing bootstrap and ADD modes as peers, with brief descriptions and pointers. Update the "Recommended order" section to distinguish bootstrap-mode order (existing) from ADD-mode order (new). The "Honest Map" recommendation from prior synthesis docs is realised: a one-line summary of layer reach, mode availability, and known limitations.

When describing ADD's diff-classification gates (S6.1), the README cross-references the existing dual-track enforcement principle that `/assurance-init` writes into onboarded repos' `docs/assurance/ROADMAP.md`. The framing positions ADD as continuing that discipline, not introducing it. (Phase 2 re-draft per B-4: avoids implying the dual-track principle is ADD-specific.)

### S7.2 — Skill catalogue updates

`docs/skills.md` gains an "ADD mode" section listing the four greenfield skills (S2.1–S2.4) and noting the mode-aware adaptations to existing skills (S3.1–S3.5).

### S7.3 — Agent registry updates

`docs/agents.md` gains an entry for the Auditor agent.

### S7.4 — Methodology pointer

A short paragraph in the main README pointing readers at `docs/add/methodology.md` and stating ADD's hypothesis status. Honest about open problems per `methodology.md` § Open problems.

---

## S8 — Phase boundaries between human and agent work in this project

**Consumes:** the README's "What the human authored, what the agent authors" section
**Produces:** the boundary the agent honors

This section makes the boundary explicit at the architectural-spec level so the agent has no ambiguity:

- The human authors `methodology.md`, `glossary.md`, `intent.md`, this architectural spec, ADR-001 through ADR-005, and `acceptance.md`.
- The agent authors `docs/add/specs/behavioral.md`, the per-module functional specs, all SKILL.md files for new skills (S2), the delta specs for existing skills (S3), the deterministic-instrumentation tool (S4.1), the Auditor agent definition (S5.1), the consolidation-pass workflow doc (S5.2), the enforcement gates (S6.1), and the documentation updates (S7).
- Both human and agent author additional ADRs as new decisions arise; per `decisions/INDEX.md`, IDs are monotonic.

The agent does not modify any human-authored Ratified artifact. To propose a change, the agent files a supersession ADR per the `decisions/INDEX.md` procedure. While Status is Drafted, the human and agent collaborate openly.

## What this spec deliberately does not specify

- The wording of any prompt template inside any skill. Functional-spec-tier concern; the agent drafts.
- The exact Dafny patterns or the spec-iterate flow internals. Out of scope; existing.
- The Auditor's prompt language or the verdict-report Markdown format. Functional-spec-tier; the agent drafts within the constraints of S5.1 and S5.2.
- Implementation language for the deterministic instrumentation. The agent picks something appropriate (likely Python or a small Go binary) and documents the choice.
- A roadmap or timeline. Premature; the agent and human scope the work after Phase 2 validation.

## Coverage table — IC ↦ S

| IC | Consumed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| IC1 (Empty-repo entrypoint) | S2.1, S3.1 | `/intent-elicit` is the entry; layer-audit detects empty state |
| IC2 (Phase 0 explicit) | S2.1 | `/intent-elicit` is the producer |
| IC3 (Phase 1 derives from intent) | S2.2, S2.5 | `/spec-derive` produces the spec stack; S2.5 declares the seam to `/spec-iterate` |
| IC4 (Phase 2 prose-vs-prose) | S2.3, S2.4 | the two prose-mode skills |
| IC5 (Three operating modes) | S1.1, S1.2 | mode tag and per-mode integrity |
| IC6 (Auditor) | S5.1, S5.2 | agent definition and workflow |
| IC7 (Diff classification) | S6.1 | gates and log |
| IC8 (Deterministic instrumentation) | S4.1, S4.2 | tool and auditor input |
| IC9 (Existing flows unchanged) | S1.1, S3.* (additive only) | default-to-bootstrap in S1.1; each S3 adaptation is gated on mode/state |
| IC10 (Documentation surfaces ADD) | S7.* | README, skills.md, agents.md |
| IC11 (B-tier linkage quality) | S1.2 | `orphan-B` and `dangling-B` integrity rules; agent-authored behavioral.md will extend with module-level invariants |

Every `IC` is consumed by at least one `S`. (The Phase 2 validation in `acceptance.md` will check this mechanically.)
