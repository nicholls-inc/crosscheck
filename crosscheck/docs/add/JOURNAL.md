# crosscheck/docs/add/JOURNAL.md

Journal for the assurance-driven development work specifically. This is the deepest shard in the current layout — it captures decisions about the methodology itself, the artifacts that support it, and the iteration cycles as they happen. Entries newest first. The retrospective at `.retrospective/findings-and-methodology-v2.md` is the long-form companion; entries here are short, link out.

## 2026-06-01 — greenfield field test recorded: `ngst` (the second README precondition)

**Type:** field-test
**Touches:** [greenfield field report](../reports/add-greenfield-field-report-ngst.md), [README](README.md), epic [#217](https://github.com/nicholls-inc/claude-code-marketplace/issues/217)
**Why:** The README named two preconditions before v3 earns a committed methodology doc — one mature-repo (recorded below, 2026-05-15) and one greenfield run. The greenfield run already happened: `~/repos/ngst` was built spec-first, invariant-anchored, from a near-empty repo. This entry records it, so the README's "greenfield pending" line is now stale. Both preconditions are met; the v3 *shape* is validated.

`ngst` exercised the whole pipeline: bootstrap + dual-track coverage gate, `/draft-invariants` (the `secrets` `_FILE`-wins catch — the first concrete proof invariant-first beats "looks fine"), the `add-orchestrator` spec-driven fast path (session `59a24679`: 14 modules, 83 invariants, 26 batched findings, disciplined triage), `/spec-adversary`, and a hand-run Phase-4 loop on the `cli` module (byfuglien + hellebuyck pre- and post-implementation review caught a coverage-gate module-derivation blocker invisible to code review).

The run *empirically motivates the open children* rather than just summarising them: the 14-module parallel draft produced five divergent heading styles (audit finding F1) — the exact inconsistency **#227** unifies. The cold-elicitation trap (`/draft-invariants` interviewing against a spec that already held the answers) produced referential-integrity failure **#150** — what greenfield mode (**#219**) must gate. The manual triage/chaining/amendment/checkbox bookkeeping on the `cli` module is the surface the Phase-4 run-to-green agent (**#218**) must own. And #150 escaped because nothing compared invariants↔spec post-draft — the Phase-5 auditor (**#220**) is that cure.

Conclusion for the methodology doc: the shape is validated but the automation is mid-flight (#218/#219/#220). Committing a canonical `methodology.md` now would lead the implementation rather than follow it — reintroducing the `plausible ≠ correct` gap. Keep it distributed (README + this journal + `orchestrator-improvements.md` + the archived ADRs + the field reports) until the children land; then write the doc to describe what shipped. On this branch the committed ledger (`crosscheck/conformance/claims.json`) still holds `CLAIM-METHODOLOGY-COMMITTED` at `known-gap` ("Never committed"); this run argues it *should move to `reviewed-disclosed`* — a transition pending **#229** — for the sharper reason: *core-validated and evolving; the doc should follow the automation, not lead it.*

## 2026-05-15 — first mature-repo field test of v3: pipeline shipped, six concrete improvement targets

**Type:** field-test
**Touches:** [field report](../reports/add-orchestrator-field-report-2026-05-15.md), [orchestrator improvements backlog](orchestrator-improvements.md)
**Why:** The v3 README said the shape was unvalidated until at least one mature-repo and one greenfield spec session had been driven against it. This entry records the first mature-repo run. The pipeline shipped the feature; six concrete orchestrator gaps surfaced and are now in the backlog.

The load-bearing finding is the **recovery property**. Mid-implementation, an agent destroyed ~2h of production-code work via an incorrect `git restore` loop, and recovery cost ~36 minutes because the spec + invariants + failing tests + per-file plan were already on disk. Every orchestrator change that makes the contract durable earlier pays back in this property; every change that defers it makes the methodology brittle in exactly that failure mode. Improvement target #1 (commit scaffolding before implementation) is the response.

The load-bearing operator feedback during the run is the second-most-important input: *keep ADD in force; automate more of finding triage where the action is mechanical.* The 38-finding triage step was where friction concentrated despite the parallel fan-out and parallel audits running at machine speed (~15 minutes total). Improvement target #2 (mechanical-vs-judgement finding classification) is the response.

One of two field tests the v3 README named as preconditions for writing a methodology doc. The other (greenfield) is still pending — until both have run, the v3 hypothesis stays a hypothesis.

## 2026-05-11 — v1 stack out, v3 starts here [ADR-0001]

**Type:** retraction
**Touches:** methodology.md, glossary.md, intent.md, acceptance.md, decisions/ (INDEX + 6 ADRs), specs/ (architectural + behavioral + M1–M6), phase-2-seam-validation report — all moved under `.retrospective/v1-archive/`. README rewritten. This journal started.
**Why:** v1 reproduced its own failure mode after one shipped iteration.
**Links:** [ADR-0001](../../../docs/decisions/0001-sharded-journal-architecture.md), [v2 retrospective](.retrospective/findings-and-methodology-v2.md)

This directory is now small on purpose. The README points readers at the retrospective and at this journal; the retrospective sketches a working hypothesis (sharded journals, a root walk-up rule, PR-merge as the human signal, a deterministic-only rule for any instrumentation tool, the five-class diff taxonomy moving from commit trailers to journal-entry types); nothing else lives here yet.

The honest state is that none of the v3 shape is validated. The retrospective's §5.3 names two spec sessions that have to happen before there's any case for writing a methodology doc — one mature-repo, one greenfield. Until both have been driven, treat the v3 hypothesis as exactly that, and read the §5.5 list in the retrospective for the symptoms that mean the form is wrong again.
