  Force-recheck handler for the Assurance PR-Gate. Contributors can comment
  `/assurance-recheck <INVARIANT-ID>` on a PR to bypass the content-hash
  cache for that invariant and rerun /crosscheck:intent-check fresh.

  This is a standalone workflow because gh-aw forbids `slash_command` and
  `pull_request` triggers in the same workflow. It shares the same plugin
  install + per-invariant plan computation as assurance-pr-gate.md, but
  scopes its work to a single invariant ID extracted from the slash
  command body.

# Assurance Recheck

You are the force-recheck handler for the Assurance PR-Gate. A contributor
commented `/assurance-recheck <INVARIANT-ID>` on a PR to bypass the cache
for one invariant.

---

## Phase 0 — Read the parsed slash args

A pre-agent step has already parsed the slash command body. Read the
result:

```bash
cat /tmp/gh-aw/recheck_target.json
```

Fields:
- `invariant_id` — extracted ID (empty string if the comment didn't match
  `/assurance-recheck <ID>`)
- `pr_number` — the PR the comment was made on
- `comment_id` — the originating comment

If `invariant_id` is empty, post a single comment and **stop**:

> **Usage:** `/assurance-recheck <INVARIANT-ID>` (e.g.
> `/assurance-recheck QUEUE-001`).

If `invariant_id` is present, continue.

---

## Phase 1 — Locate the invariant

Look up the invariant ID in the PR's changed `docs/invariants/*.md` files.
The pre-step has already computed the per-invariant plan in
`/tmp/gh-aw/pr_gate_plan.json`.

```bash
cat /tmp/gh-aw/pr_gate_plan.json
```

Find the entry where `invariant_id == <ID>`. If no entry exists (the
invariant isn't in any changed doc), post:

> **Cannot recheck `<ID>`** — that invariant isn't in any
> `docs/invariants/*.md` file changed by this PR. Recheck applies only to
> invariants whose docs / tests / module source are part of the PR diff.

…and stop.

---

## Phase 2 — Run intent-check fresh (bypass cache)

For the located invariant entry, **ignore** the `cache_hit` and
`cached_attestation` fields entirely. Run `/crosscheck:intent-check` fresh
with:

- The invariant prose (from the changed doc).
- The covering test sources (paths in `covering_tests`).
- The module source diff
  (`git diff origin/<base>...HEAD -- <module-paths>`).

The skill will append a row to `.assurance/intent-check-fp-tracker.csv`
and emit a JSON attestation. **Save it to**
`docs/assurance/attestations/<content_hash>.json` and push it back to the
PR branch via the `push-to-pull-request-branch` safe-output.

If the new content hash matches the cached one but the verdict differs,
that's a notable event — log it in the comment ("Force-recheck produced
a different verdict from the cached attestation; this is rare and worth
investigating").

---

## Phase 3 — Post the verdict

Post a single PR comment:

> **Layer 5 — Force-rechecked (cache bypassed)**
>
> Invariant: `<ID>` (`<name>`) in `docs/invariants/<module>.md`
> Verdict: **<PASS|FLAG|UNCERTAIN>**
> Attestation: `sha256:<content_hash>` (`docs/assurance/attestations/<hash>.json`)
> Triggered by: `/assurance-recheck` on `<commenter handle>`
> FP-tracker rolling 14 d: <rate>% (n=<count>)
>
> <one-paragraph summary of the back-translation diff>
>
> _Layer 5 is probabilistic; this re-run bypassed the cache by request._

If the new verdict differs from the cached one, prepend:

> **Verdict changed on force-recheck.** Cached: `<old>`; fresh:
> `<new>`. Inputs hash unchanged → the LLM produced a different
> back-translation. This is a rare signal — please surface to the
> assurance maintainer.

---

## Operating principles

1. **Single invariant only.** This workflow rechecks exactly one ID. Do
   not run a generic gate pass.
2. **Cache bypass is the whole point.** Never short-circuit. Always run
   intent-check fresh.
3. **Push the attestation.** The fresh attestation must be committed and
   pushed via `push-to-pull-request-branch` so the new verdict becomes
   the canonical one for that hash.
4. **No silent failures.** If the invariant ID can't be located or the
   slash command is mis-formatted, post a clear usage / "not found"
   comment and stop.
