# Plan: crosscheck: assurance-probe — deterministic test-strength layer (design discussion)

## Verification track
formal

**Track interpretation**: "formal" here means **Layer 4 deterministic property testing** (reproducible, bounded, rotation-based), NOT Layer 1 Dafny proofs. The skill orchestrates external test execution and mutation analysis; it has no provable business logic suitable for formal verification.

## Steps

1. **Create skill definition** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/SKILL.md`
   - Layer 4 (deterministic strength) skill scaffolding
   - Mutation probe, vacuity probe, and generator probe instructions (phase-gated)
   - Issue-only output pattern matching `/spec-adversary`
   - Bounded output (≤3 findings), rotation-based, kill criterion from day 1
   - Integration with `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv` tracking
   - **Zero-finding output**: If no mutations survive, emit success message "No test-strength issues found for module X" with no GitHub issue created

2. **Create mutation framework** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/lib/mutations.py`
   - Parse `Failure condition` clause from invariant docs
   - **Phase 1 grammar**: Simple predicates only — `<var> <op> <literal>` where `<op>` ∈ {`<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `in`, `not in`}. Examples: `x < 0`, `len(arr) > MAX_SIZE`, `key not in cache`. Multi-line or nested conditions → skip with warning "Complex Failure condition in [doc]; Phase 1 supports simple predicates only."
   - **Empty/unparseable clauses**: Skip invariant with warning "No parseable Failure condition in [doc]; skipping mutation probe." Include skip count in tracker CSV (`proposed=0, skipped=1`).
   - Generate 1-3 targeted source mutations per invariant
   - **Mutation soundness constraint**: Each mutation must target an AST node (variable, operator, literal) explicitly referenced in the Failure condition. Parser validates this; if no AST match, skip with warning.
   - Apply mutation, run covering test, capture killed/survived/errored verdict
   - **Error handling**: Syntax errors in mutated code → `errored` verdict (not `survived`). Test framework crashes → `errored`. Timeout (>30s per test) → `errored`.
   - Deterministic, reproducible results (bit-identical on re-run with same environment)
   - Phase 1: Python-only support

3. **Create vacuity probe** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/lib/vacuity.py`
   - **Pre-flight check**: Verify `pytest-cov` installed via `importlib.util.find_spec("pytest_cov")`. If absent, fail-fast with error: "pytest-cov not found; install via 'pip install pytest-cov' to enable vacuity probe."
   - Delete covering test temporarily, run pytest with `--cov`
   - Compute branch-coverage delta for protected module
   - Zero delta = test not load-bearing for that module
   - Restore test after probe (use Git worktree to avoid working-directory mutation)
   - Phase 2 (deferred until Phase 1 demonstrates SNR ≥ 1:3)

4. **Create generator probe** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/lib/hypothesis_probe.py`
   - Static inspection of Hypothesis strategies
   - Check if strategy can produce inputs in failure-condition region
   - Report unreachable failure regions
   - Phase 3 (deferred)

5. **Create reproducer template** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/templates/reproducer.py.template`
   - Standalone script that re-runs probe findings
   - **Environment capture**: Template validates and captures:
     - Git commit SHA (via `subprocess.check_output(['git', 'rev-parse', 'HEAD'])`)
     - Python version (via `sys.version_info[:2]`; error if mismatch with current env)
     - Top-level dependencies: `pytest`, `hypothesis` versions (via `importlib.metadata.version()`)
     - OS/platform (via `platform.system()`; informational only)
   - **Error on mismatch**: If commit SHA differs, emit: "Reproducer recorded on commit {recorded}, currently on {actual}. Findings may not reproduce." Exit code 2.
   - Committed to adopter repo at `scripts/probe/<module>_<YYYYMMDD>.py`
   - Ensures bit-identical results on same commit + same Python version + same dependencies
   - Opt-in flag for in-tree placement vs issue-body-only

6. **Create tracker template** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/templates/probe-tracker.csv.template`
   - Mirrors `.assurance/spec-adversary-log.csv` shape
   - Tracks: `date, module, proposed, accepted, rejected, deferred, skipped` (added `skipped` column for unparseable invariants)
   - SNR calculation for kill-criterion enforcement
   - **Concurrency safety**: Mutation framework acquires file lock (`fcntl.flock` on Unix, `msvcrt.locking` on Windows) before appending row. Lock released after write. Timeout: 10s; if lock unavailable, emit warning and write to `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv.pending` for manual merge.
   - **Atomic write**: Write to temp file, then rename (POSIX atomic) to avoid partial writes

7. **Create GitHub issue template** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/templates/issue.md.template`
   - At most 3 findings per run
   - Each finding: mutation diff, test command, observed result (`killed` | `survived` | `errored`)
   - Accept/reject/defer triage block per finding
   - Link to reproducer script
   - **Zero-invariant handling**: If module has no invariant docs, issue not created; rotation summary notes "Module X: 0 invariants found; skipping probe."

8. **Update assurance hierarchy docs** — `crosscheck/docs/assurance-hierarchy.md`
   - Add `/assurance-probe` to Layer 4 row in skill→layer mapping table
   - **Experimental label**: Mark as "Layer 4 (Phase 1 – experimental; gates on SNR ≥ 1:3 over 20 runs)"
   - Update "Getting started" section to mention probe in rotation workflow
   - Add probe to "When to use what" decision tree

9. **Update crosscheck README** — `crosscheck/README.md`
   - Add `/assurance-probe` to Layer 4 bullet in "What you can run right now"
   - **Experimental label**: Suffix with "(Phase 1 – experimental)" until SNR ≥ 1:3 demonstrated
   - Add to Skills overview section under "Assurance hierarchy & governance"
   - Add worked example to "Worked examples" section

10. **Create demo script** — `crosscheck/demo/07_test_strength/SCRIPT.md`
    - Demonstrate mutation probe on a real invariant
    - Show killed/survived/errored verdicts
    - Show reproducer script in action
    - Timing budget: ~5 minutes

11. **Update byfuglien agent** — `crosscheck/agents/byfuglien.md`
    - Add `/assurance-probe` to skill registry
    - Add routing rule for "test strength", "mutation testing", "invariant probe" triggers
    - **Rotation mechanics**: Probe is rotation-based, not per-PR. Triggered manually via byfuglien query ("run assurance probe on module X") or `/assurance-status` recommendation ("Last probe: 4 weeks ago; consider re-running"). Recommended frequency: every 2-4 weeks per active module (modules with ≥1 invariant doc added/modified in last 90 days).
    - **Additive-only routing**: New routing rule appends to existing registry; no modification of `/spec-adversary`, `/assurance-init`, etc. routes. If skill is retired, routing rule can be deleted without side effects.

12. **Create reference documentation** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/references/phase-gating.md`
    - Phase 1: mutation probe (Python-only)
    - Phase 2: vacuity probe (gates on Phase 1 SNR ≥ 1:3)
    - Phase 3: generator probe (gates on Phase 2 success)
    - Kill criterion: SNR <1:5 over 4 weeks (minimum 20 probe runs) → retire for that module

## Tests / properties to add

- **Unit test for mutation parser** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/tests/test_mutations.py`
  - Parse `Failure condition` clause from invariant doc
  - **Correctness oracle**: Reference table with 5 examples:
    ```python
    [
      ("x < 0", [("x", ">=", "0"), ("x", "==", "-1")]),  # boundary mutation + example violation
      ("len(arr) > MAX_SIZE", [("len(arr)", "<=", "MAX_SIZE"), ("len(arr)", "==", "MAX_SIZE")]),
      ("key not in cache", [("key", "in", "cache")]),
      ("balance >= 100", [("balance", "<", "100"), ("balance", "==", "99")]),
      ("state == READY", [("state", "!=", "READY"), ("state", "==", "PENDING")])
    ]
    ```
  - Assert `parse_and_mutate(clause) == expected_mutations` for each entry
  - Property: mutations are deterministic (same input → same mutations on repeated calls)

- **Unit test for vacuity detector** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/tests/test_vacuity.py`
  - Coverage delta computation
  - Property: deleting test and restoring leaves repo unchanged (Git worktree ensures no dirty state)

- **Integration test for reproducer** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/tests/test_reproducer.py`
  - **Positive case**: Run reproducer script twice on same commit, assert bit-identical output (exit code, stdout, stderr)
  - **Negative case**: Mutate source file (introduce mutation), run reproducer, assert output differs (mutation survived → mutation killed, or vice versa). Then revert mutation, assert original output restored.
  - Property: reproducer is truly deterministic on same commit + environment

- **E2E test for probe workflow** — `crosscheck/skills/assurance-probe/tests/test_e2e.py`
  - **Real executable code**: Scaffold adopter repo with:
    - `src/validator.py`: function `validate_input(x: int) -> bool: return x >= 0`
    - `invariants/validator.md`: Failure condition "`x < 0`"
    - `tests/test_validator.py`: Hypothesis test with `integers()` strategy
  - **Real killable mutation**: Mutate `x >= 0` to `x > 0` (off-by-one; test should kill if strategy includes `x=0`)
  - Run probe, verify issue output (1 finding: mutation survived or killed depending on strategy)
  - Verify tracker CSV update (1 row appended, columns match schema)
  - Property: ≤3 findings per run (test with 5 invariants in `invariants/`, assert output has ≤3)
  - **Zero-invariant fixture**: Add test case with empty `invariants/` directory; assert no issue created, tracker shows `proposed=0, skipped=0`

## Verification approach

### Formal verification (Layer 1)
Not applicable for this skill — the skill orchestrates test execution and mutation, not pure business logic.

### Deterministic verification (Layer 4)
1. **Mutation determinism proof**: Given the same `Failure condition` clause, the mutation generator must produce the same set of mutations every time. Test via property-based tests with Hypothesis:
   - `∀ clause: parse(clause) == parse(clause)`
   - `∀ (clause, seed): mutations(clause, seed) == mutations(clause, seed)`

2. **Reproducer bit-identical property**: The reproducer script must produce identical output on the same commit + Python version + dependencies:
   - Run script twice on commit `C` with Python `P` and deps `D`
   - Assert `output_1 == output_2` (exit code, stdout, stderr)
   - Formalized as a pytest parametrized test over 5 real invariant docs
   - **Environment locked**: Git SHA, Python `major.minor`, pytest version, hypothesis version. OS/platform informational only (not enforced, but logged).

3. **Bounded output enforcement**: The skill must never emit >3 findings per run:
   - Property test: `∀ (module, invariants): len(probe(module, invariants).findings) ≤ 3`
   - Test with modules having 5, 10, 20 invariants

4. **Tracker integrity**: Each probe run must append exactly one row to `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv`:
   - Before: `wc -l tracker.csv` → N
   - After: `wc -l tracker.csv` → N+1
   - **Atomic write + backup**: Before write, copy tracker to `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv.backup`. Write to `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv.tmp`, then rename. If rename fails, restore from backup with error message.
   - Checksum validation: SHA256 of rows 1..N unchanged (backup serves as checksum source)

### Semi-formal verification (Layer 5)
Use `/reason` to verify the probe's output on a demo invariant from `demo/07_test_strength/`:
- Does the mutation probe correctly identify a vacuous test?
- Does the reproducer script accurately capture the mutation?
- Does the SNR calculation correctly track findings over time?

Produce an evidence log (similar to `/rationale` output) showing:
- Mutation is derived from `Failure condition` clause (AST node match)
- Test execution verdict matches expected behavior (killed/survived/errored)
- Reproducer script matches committed artifact

## Risk register

- **Risk**: Mutation framework generates non-deterministic mutations due to Python's dict iteration order
  - **Mitigation**: Sort mutations by a canonical key (e.g., line number + mutation type) before returning

- **Risk**: Probe runs take >5 minutes on large modules, blocking rotation workflow
  - **Mitigation**: Hard timeout at 5 minutes per module; emit partial results with warning; add to kill criteria

- **Risk**: Vacuity probe deletes test but fails to restore, leaving repo in dirty state
  - **Mitigation**: Use Git worktree or copy; never modify working directory directly. Property test: restore always succeeds.

- **Risk**: Reproducer script committed to repo clutters `scripts/probe/` with stale artifacts
  - **Mitigation**: Document cleanup policy in skill instructions (e.g., delete reproducers >90 days old). Add `.gitignore` entry for `scripts/probe/` in template.

- **Risk**: SNR <1:5 kill criterion triggers prematurely on new adopters (small sample size)
  - **Mitigation**: Require minimum 20 probe runs before SNR is enforceable; document in phase-gating.md

- **Risk**: Phase-gating creates confusion (users try to run Phase 2/3 before Phase 1 succeeds)
  - **Mitigation**: Skill checks `.assurance/probe-tracker.csv` SNR before allowing Phase 2. Emit clear error with SNR value.

- **Risk**: Probe output conflicts with `/spec-adversary` output (both propose changes to same invariant)
  - **Mitigation**: Probe does NOT propose new invariants; it only tests strength of existing ones. Document clear boundary.

- **Risk**: Mutation parser fails on complex `Failure condition` clauses (nested conditions, multi-line)
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 1 supports simple conditions only (single predicate). Complex conditions emit "unsupported" warning and skip. Reference table in tests defines supported grammar.

- **Risk**: Generator probe (Phase 3) reports false positives on Hypothesis strategies with complex dependencies
  - **Mitigation**: Phase 3 deferred until Phase 1/2 demonstrate value. Require human review on all generator findings.

- **Risk (Phase 1 limitation)**: Mutation soundness — generated mutations may not be reachable by the covering test's input generator
  - **Rationale**: Full reachability analysis requires symbolic execution or constraint solving (out of scope for Phase 1). Phase 1 constraint "mutation targets AST node in Failure condition" ensures syntactic alignment but not semantic reachability.
  - **Mitigation**: Document as known limitation in `references/phase-gating.md`. Phase 3 generator probe (Hypothesis strategy inspection) will partially mitigate by flagging unreachable failure regions. Accept false negatives (mutations that survive due to generator gaps, not test weaknesses) as inherent to deterministic mutation testing.
  - **Acceptance criterion**: SNR ≥ 1:3 (signal-to-noise) indicates practical value despite false negatives. If SNR <1:5 over 20 runs, kill criterion triggers.

- **Risk**: Reproducer environment mismatch causes spurious "cannot reproduce" reports
  - **Mitigation**: Step 5 template validates Git SHA, Python `major.minor`, pytest version, hypothesis version. Emit clear error with actual vs. expected values on mismatch. Document required environment lockdown in `SKILL.md` and demo script.
